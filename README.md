# Mask-RCNN-Object-Detection-and-Segmentation
Developed a Python object detection and segmentation framework using Mask-RCNN with 50% confidence detection and 30% mask accuracy in segmentation. It performs real-time media processing with reduced inference time through OpenCV along with CUDA-accelerated GPU acceleration. Supports 80+ MS COCO classes.
